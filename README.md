# 📦 Product Inventory Management System 🛒

## 🌟 Introduction
In today's fast-paced retail and business environment, managing product inventory efficiently is crucial for success. Digital platforms that provide seamless inventory tracking, robust product management, and real-time stock monitoring have become indispensable. To address this need, the CEO of a forward-thinking product management startup has tasked a team of developers with creating a **Product Inventory Management System** powered by **Angular**.

This system is designed to help businesses organize their inventory effectively by adding, updating, deleting, and categorizing products. Users can manage product details such as descriptions, prices, and manufacturers while maintaining an optimized stock level. Additionally, administrators can securely log in, perform inventory actions, and monitor stock status in real time. 🔄

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
This project is built using **Angular CLI version 19.2.3**, leveraging modern web development tools to ensure performance, scalability, and maintainability.

## 🚀 Features
- 🏷️ **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products with detailed descriptions.
- 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**: Automatic UI updates when inventory changes.
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation.

## ⚙️ Getting Started
### ▶️ Development Server
To start a local development server, run:
```sh
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:4200/**. The application will automatically reload whenever changes are made to the source files. 🌐💻

### 🏗️ Code Scaffolding
Angular CLI includes powerful scaffolding tools for generating new components and features. To create a new component, run:
```sh
ng generate component component-name
```
For a full list of available schematics (components, directives, services, etc.), execute:
```sh
ng generate --help
```

### 🏭 Building the Project
To compile the application and generate optimized production-ready files, run:
```sh
ng build
```
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 📦

### 🧪 Running Unit Tests
Execute unit tests with the **Karma test runner** using:
```sh
ng test
```
